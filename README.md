# smart_green_house

This project aims to design and build a smart mini-greenhouse using an embedded microcontroller system (ESP32).  The system autonomously monitors and controls environmental conditions such as soil moisture, air temperature, and, optionally, light intensity, to maintain optimal growing conditions for the plants.

Using environmental sensors, the system collects data and makes decisions based on configurable thresholds. It can automatically activate irrigation (pump) and, optionally, lighting (LEDs) to regulate the internal environment.
