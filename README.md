# smart_green_house
This project aims to design and build a smart mini-greenhouse using an embedded microcontroller system (ESP32).  The system autonomously monitors and controls environmental conditions such as soil moisture, air temperature, and, optionally, light intensity, to maintain optimal growing conditions for the plants.
